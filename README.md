# I-SKY-U
In the modern world, individuals often face health challenges that are both physical (e.g., heart, lungs, liver, and brain disorders) and mental (e.g., stress, anxiety, and depression). However, these issues are frequently diagnosed too late due to lack of accessible, integrated, and preventive healthcare systems.
This project aims to develop a comprehensive health monitoring system that:
1. Diagnoses early symptoms of critical diseases related to the heart, lungs, liver, and brain using patient input data and clinical markers (e.g., medical history, symptoms, lifestyle).
2. Provides preventive support for mental health by recommending personalized wellness services such as lauging exercises , calming music, yoga sessions, and more.
The goal is to build a smart platform that supports both predictive diagnosis and therapeutic suggestions â€” helping users take charge of their overall well-being.
